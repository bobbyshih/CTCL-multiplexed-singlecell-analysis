# CTCL-multiplexed-singlecell-analysis
Multiplexed (TCR, Cell Surface Protein, Gene expression) single-cell analysis of a single CTCL patient sample as a proof-of-principle before expanding this analysis pipeline to a broader cohort of patient samples. The goal of the project was to (1) identify tumor cells, (2) identify mechanisms of lymphomagenesis that may represent therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities, and (3) identify mechanisms of resistance to current therapeutic regiments in advanced relapsed/refractory disease.
